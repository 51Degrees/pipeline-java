    /**
     * Constructor
     * The callback mechanism is a feature that allows the client-side
     * data to be updated in the background when any properties that
     * contain JavaScript code have been executed on the client and
     * therefore, new evidence is available.
     * @param objName the name of the global-scope JavaScript object that will
     *                be created on the client-side by the JavaScript produced
     *                by the template.
     * @param jsonObject the JSON data payload to be inserted into the template.
     * @param supportsPromises if true, the template will produce JavaScript
     *                         that makes use of promises. If false, promises
     *                         will not be used.
     * @param url the complete URL to use for the callback mechanism described
     *            in remarks for this constructor.
     * @param enableCookies if false, any cookies created by JavaScript
     *                      properties that execute on the client-side and that
     *                      start with '51D_' will be deleted automatically.
     * @param updateEnabled true to use the callback mechanism that is described
     *                      in remarks for this constructor. False to disable
     *                      that mechanism. In this case, a second request must
     *                      be initiated by the user in order for the server to
     *                      access the additional evidence gathered by
     *                      client-side code.
     * @param hasDelayedProperties true to include support for JavaScript
     *                             properties that are not executed immediately
     *                             when the JavaScript is loaded.
