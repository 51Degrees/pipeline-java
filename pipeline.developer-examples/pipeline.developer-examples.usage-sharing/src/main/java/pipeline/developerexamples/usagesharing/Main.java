/**

 * 
 * Usage sharing is enabled by default if using a pipeline builder 
 * that is derived from FiftyOnePipelineBuilder.
 * For instance, the DeviceDetectionPipelineBuilder.
 * In this example, we show how to add a ShareUsageElement to a 
 * Pipeline using configuration.
 * 
 * As with all ElementBuilders, this can also be handled in code, 
 * using the ShareUsageBuilder. The commented section in the example 
 * demonstrates this.
 * 
 * The 51d.xml file contains all the configuration options.
 * These are all optional, so each can be omitted if the default 
 * for that option is sufficient:
 * 
 * @include pipeline.developer-examples.usage-sharing/src/main/resources/51d.xml
 * 
 * For details of what each setting does, see the reference documentation 
 * for the [share usage builder](http://51degrees.com/pipeline-java/4.3/classfiftyone_1_1pipeline_1_1engines_1_1fiftyone_1_1flowelements_1_1_share_usage_builder_base.html) 
 * 
 * This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/pipeline-java/blob/master/pipeline.developer-examples/pipeline.developer-examples.usage-sharing/src/main/java/pipeline/developerexamples/usagesharing/Main.java).
 * 
 * Expected output:
 * ```
 * Constructing pipeline from configuration file.
 * 
 * Pipeline created with share usage element. Evidence processed 
 * with this pipeline will now be shared with 51Degrees using the 
 * specified configuration.
 * ```
